# Curricular Materials for Epidemics

Motivated by current events, I developed a curricular vignette that relates the spread of a virus with a significant latency period to the eigenvalues of 2x2 matrices.  If you or your colleagues would like to incorporate these materials please do so.  They could be worked into a first course in ODEs, a course in linear algebra, or a course in mathematical modeling.

# What is this repository?

We created a Binder repository so that you can play with a model for spread of epidemics.
