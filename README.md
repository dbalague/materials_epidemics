# Curricular Materials for Epidemics

Motivated by current events, and by the need to keep the students in my MATH 224 (intro ordinary equations) 
course paying attention to linear systems theory, I put together a few slides and a simple matlab script 
relating the eigenvalues of a 2x2 matrix to the initial growth rate of an epidemic with a latent infective phase.  
For those of you teaching Math 224 or 228 (there are many of us) please feel free to use (or ignore) 
these materials, as you see fit.  I made up the model out of thin air, without consulting authorities.
Its goal is merely pedagogical -- a compelling (I hope) application of linear systems of DEs.
